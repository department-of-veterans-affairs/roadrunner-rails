[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/department-of-veterans-affairs/roadrunner-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/department-of-veterans-affairs/roadrunner-rails)

Roadrunner Rails is a template for new Rails projects for the VA. It's pre-customized to work within the VA ecosystem.

## Ruby Setup

In order to use Roadrunner Rails, you'll need Ruby installed, and `rbenv` to manage your Ruby versions.
Follow the instructions to [install `rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) and then to [install Ruby 2.3](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions).

## Other Dependencies

You'll need to install the following other applications and libraries.

- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
    - Mac w/ Homebrew: `brew install phantomjs`

## Creating a New Roadrunner Project

First, clone the `roadrunner-rails` repository into a new folder with your project name.
Separate words in the folder name using hyphens (example: `my-new-project`).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/roadrunner-rails my-new-project
```

Then run the setup script:

```
$ cd my-new-project
$ ./bin/setup
```
After that, you should be ready to roll! Use any of the Rails commands (like `rails s`) or try some of the commands below.

Following this, there are a few last things you should do:

- Add your project to a new [GitHub](http://github.com) repository
    - Make the `master` branch a protected branch
- Enable [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to build/lint your code when new pull requests are committed
- Fill in the details in the generated README.md file (including updating the TravisCI image)

Beep, beep!

## Commands
- `bundle exec rake lint` - Run the full suite of linters on the codebase.
- `bundle exec guard` - Runs the guard test server that reruns your tests after files are saved. Useful for TDD!
- `bundle exec rake security` - Run the suite of security scanners on the codebase.
- `bundle exec rake ci` - Run all build steps performed in Travis CI.

## Gems
Roadrunner Rails adds some additional gems for making Rails development better.

### Testing
- [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) - Ruby testing framework for readable BDD tests.
- [RSpec Rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) - Rails helpers for rSpec.
- [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - Testing server for better TDD flow.
- [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) - DSL for easily writing automated feature tests.
- [Sniffybara](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/sniffybara) - Custom Poltergeist (PhantomJS) driver for Capybara that checks for accessibility defects in your feature tests.

### Linting
- [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) for Ruby style linting.
- [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) configured with [18F's CSS coding styleguide](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/).
- [jshint](https://github.com/damian/jshint) for Javascript.

### Security
- [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) for Rails static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) for checking known security vulnerabilities of gems.
